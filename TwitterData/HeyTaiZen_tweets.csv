950428645167902721,2018-01-08 18:07:01,@BARBIEBUYSDIPS @ToneVays Agreed.  But when u short u r borrowing btc to sell xrp. so u are facing 2 risks. a) price of xrp going up can hurt u and b) price of btc going up can hurt u. So u can be right on direction of xrp n still lose money cuz btc went up... no need to expose oneself to more risk...
950428050231054336,2018-01-08 18:04:39,@digitsu Definitely agree.  i had to spend over 2 hrs yesterday to help an attorney figure out how to make a @litecoin segwit transaction between @coinbase &amp; @LedgerHQ.

Problem I see in BTC is a lack of governance so I can not support a throughput speed solution to solve a lack of governance. we see 2 different problems in BTC so solution will not be the same.
