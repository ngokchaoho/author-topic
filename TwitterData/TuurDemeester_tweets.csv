1078687271782621184,2018-12-28 16:21:01,"46/ Also, I have done my share of soul searching about whether I could be suffering from survivor‚Äôs bias. https://t.co/0IXwdvpILO"
1078687270897635330,2018-12-28 16:21:01,"45/ Actually, I was initially excited about Ethereum‚Äôs smart contract work - this was before one of its many pivots. https://t.co/7XoEd2vi0L"
1078687270151041024,2018-12-28 16:21:00,"44/ Do I have a conflict of interest? ETH is a publicly available asset with no real barriers to entry, so I could easily get a stake. Also, having met Vitalik &amp; other ETH founders several times in 2013-‚Äô14, it would have been doable for me to become part of the in-crowd."
1078687269450588166,2018-12-28 16:21:00,"43/ This is becoming a long tweetstorm, so let‚Äôs wrap up with a few closing comments."
1078687268498538496,2018-12-28 16:21:00,"42/ Perhaps the recently added Gandalf of Ethereum, with his ‚ÄúFellowship of Ethereum Magicians‚Äù [sic] can save the day, but imo that seems unlikely:
 https://t.co/f1XaxV0Gnc"
1078687267475066881,2018-12-28 16:21:00,"41/ For a while, Microsoft veteran Lucius Meredith was mentioned as playing an important role in ETH scaling, but now he is likely distracted by the failure of his ETH scaling company RChain.  https://t.co/BQh7XqFNHy https://t.co/a2ZZhF0NKX"
1078687266439118851,2018-12-28 16:21:00,40/ Another red flag to me is the apparent lack of relevant expertise in the ETH development community. (Check the responses‚Ä¶)  https://t.co/LoBIoM2t22
1078687264715272192,2018-12-28 16:20:59,"39/ Other potential signs of centralization: Vitalik Buterin signing a deal with a Russian government institution, and ETH core developers experimenting with semi-closed meetings:

1078687263935160320,2018-12-28 16:20:59,"38/ Yet later that year, after only 6% of ETH holders had cast a vote, ETH core devs decided to endorse a hard-fork that clawed back the funds from a smart contract that held 4.5% of all ETH in circulation. More here: https://t.co/Fgu9e3hc2m"
1078687262999830530,2018-12-28 16:20:59,"37/ Another hollow claim: in 2016, Ethereum was promoted as being censorship resistant‚Ä¶ https://t.co/aXqU34TauX"
1078687262047641600,2018-12-28 16:20:58,"36/ As a result, and despite the claims that running a node in ‚Äúwarp‚Äù mode is easy and as good as a full node, Ethereum is becoming increasingly centralized. https://t.co/ffj3wZuChy"
1078687260802015233,2018-12-28 16:20:58,"35/ By now the Ethereum bloat is so bad that cheaply running an individual node is practically impossible for a lay person. ETH developers are also imploring people  to not deploy more smart contract apps on its blockchain. 
https://t.co/f1TebqVO2s"
1078687259765997569,2018-12-28 16:20:58,"34/ Another huge issue that Ethereum has is with scaling. By putting ‚Äúeverything on the blockchain‚Äù (which stores everything forever) and dubbing it ‚Äúthe world computer‚Äù, you are going to end up with a very slow and clogged up system.  https://t.co/89MSVUXBak"
1078687258952257537,2018-12-28 16:20:58,"33/ The modular approach to Bitcoin seems to be much better at compartmentalizing risk, and thus reducing attack surfaces.  I‚Äôve written about modular scaling here: https://t.co/EvkatqCPm0"
1078687257035296769,2018-12-28 16:20:57,"32/ This was criticized by P2P &amp; OS developers as a reckless notion, given that every smart contracts is actually a ‚Äúde novo cryptographic protocol‚Äù. In other words, it‚Äôs playing with fire.  https://t.co/RpCgFGIgsa https://t.co/rDiamZouY3"
1078685115289608193,2018-12-28 16:12:27,"31/ Another idea that was marketed heavily early on, was that with ETH you could program smart contract as easily as javascript applications. 
https://t.co/KpaK7Hhp4d"
1078685113385451520,2018-12-28 16:12:26,"30/ Of course, nothing came of this, because anything in the ETH protocol can be hard-forked away. Another broken promise.   
https://t.co/fSP75oxtkY"
1078685112609443841,2018-12-28 16:12:26,"29/ In order to ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù the transition to PoS‚Äô utopia of perpetual income (staking coins earns interest), a ‚Äúdifficulty bomb‚Äù was embedded in the protocol, which supposedly would force miners to accept the transition. https://t.co/fs35gd6Z8R"
1078685111879716865,2018-12-28 16:12:26,28/ Let me share a few more inconvenient truths.
1078685111061753856,2018-12-28 16:12:26,"27/ This kind of sophistry is exhausting and completely counter-productive, but it can be very convincing for an uninformed retail public."
1078685109094621184,2018-12-28 16:12:25,"26/ Rebuttal:
- BTC layer 1 is not ‚Äújust a phase‚Äù, it always will be its definitive bedrock for transaction settlement.
- Soft forking digital protocols has been the norm for over 3 decades‚Äîhard-forks are the deviation! 
- Satoshi never suggested hyperbitcoinization as a goal."
1078685108062875648,2018-12-28 16:12:25,"25/ In his response to my tweet, Vitalik adopted my format to ‚Äúplay the same game‚Äù in criticizing Bitcoin. My criticisms weren't addressed, and his response was riddled with errors. Yet his followers gave it +1,000 upvotes!   https://t.co/OqPbRzNCDN"
1078685107010048001,2018-12-28 16:12:25,"24/ My third point addresses PoS‚Äô promise of perpetual income to ETHizens. Vitalik is no stranger to embracing free lunch ideas, e.g. during his 2014 ETH announcement speech, where he described a coin with a 20% inflation tax as having ‚Äúno cost‚Äù to users. https://t.co/7ufDYcs460"
1078685106099970049,2018-12-28 16:12:24,"23/ My second point addresses Ethereum‚Äôs romance with the vague and dangerous notion of ‚Äòsocial consensus‚Äô, where disruptive hard-forks are used to ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô or ‚Äòoptimize‚Äô the system, which inevitably leads to increased centralization. More here: https://t.co/lcrijksOsk"
1078685104241815552,2018-12-28 16:12:24,"22/ My first point, about Ethereum developers rejecting Proof-of-Work, has been illustrated many times over By Vitalik and others. (See earlier in this tweetstorm for more about how PoS is unproven.) https://t.co/AvtmxJZdsb"
1078682824838926336,2018-12-28 16:03:21,"21/ I was very serious about my criticism. In fact, each one of the three points addressed what Vitalik Buterin has described as ‚Äúunique value propositions of Ethereum proper‚Äù. https://t.co/b9yHspun7B https://t.co/hwrVvRlKdK"
1078682823865839616,2018-12-28 16:03:20,"20/ A few days ago, I shared a critical tweet that made the argument that Ethereum‚Äôs value proposition is in essence utopian. https://t.co/3ByBXGfxMW"
1078682823190609923,2018-12-28 16:03:20,19/  Let‚Äôs illustrate with an example.
1078682822402035712,2018-12-28 16:03:20,"18/ One of my big concerns is that sophistry and marketing hype is a serious part of Ethereum‚Äôs success so far, and that overly inflated expectations have lead to an inflated market cap."
1078682820002959361,2018-12-28 16:03:19,"17/ Over the years, this has become a pattern in Ethereum‚Äôs culture: recycling old ideas while not properly referring to past research and having poor peer review standards. This is _not_ how science progresses. https://t.co/kUhd2NuIJt"
1078682818266492930,2018-12-28 16:03:19,"16/ Keep in mind that Proof of Stake (PoS) is not a new concept at all. Proof-of-Work actually was one of the big innovations that made Bitcoin possible, after PoS was deemed impractical because of censorship vulnerability.   https://t.co/AMsWwUcYeI"
1078682817339539457,2018-12-28 16:03:19,15/ Also check out this thread about how Proof of Stake blockchains require subjectivity (i.e. a trusted third party) to achieve consensus: https://t.co/XTyl9qjA2U and this thread on r/Bitcoin: https://t.co/AMTp57bqCt
1078682816077025282,2018-12-28 16:03:18,"14/ For the uninitiated, here‚Äôs a good write-up that highlights some of the fundamental design problems of proof-of-stake. Like I said, this is science experiment territory. https://t.co/BA1ukxqxsp"
1078682814873300993,2018-12-28 16:03:18,"13/ The elephant in the room is the transition to proof-of-stake, an ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly‚Äù way to secure the chain. (If this was the plan all along, why create a proof-of-work chain first?) https://t.co/YCuFiE0m0T"
1078682814021881856,2018-12-28 16:03:18,"12/ However, upon closer examination it was the recycling of some stale ideas, and the project went nowhere: https://t.co/DWY1PBtp6B"

1009826019069620224,2018-06-21 15:50:59,"34/ TL;DR Governments use monetary intervention as a swiss army knife for society‚Äôs problems. This undermines the function of money and has unintended consequences. Politically neutral protocols like Bitcoin could be superior because they are reliable, robust, and modular."
1009826018117419009,2018-06-21 15:50:59,"33/ And so I see Bitcoin as a small but performant monetary building block that can serve to diminish interpersonal conflict in society. Much technology and many institutions will need to be built around it, no doubt. But it‚Äôs an exhilarating start."
1009826016993431552,2018-06-21 15:50:58,"32/ I‚Äôm a strong believer in modular scaling, and I think history backs me up on this: that robust complex systems (including prosperous, thriving societies) are consistently built out of simple, performant mechanisms that lock into each other in a modular way."
1009826015596736518,2018-06-21 15:50:58,"31/ Here‚Äôs is the problem I see with monetary interventionism: it is trying to solve many problems using the same toolset, resulting in unintended consequences and an ultimately unreliable monetary infrastructure."
1009826014594322432,2018-06-21 15:50:58,"30/ Of course, Bitcoin in itself isn‚Äôt going to solve all the interpersonal problems that governments are trying to solve. But it holds the promise of doing one thing extremely well: be a reliable form of money."
1009826013428281346,2018-06-21 15:50:57,"29/ Bitcoin diminishes conflicts by means of technology, much like how car locks diminish car thefts. It‚Äôs a protocol that allows users to peacefully enforce their right to control their own financial future."
1009826011654098944,2018-06-21 15:50:57,"28/ And so, paradoxically, by efficiently removing free access to a scarce monetary good, Bitcoin becomes a socially scalable technological enforcer of property rights."
1009826010609672192,2018-06-21 15:50:57,"27/ This triple combo allows for bitcoin to be highly divisible, highly portable and scalable, highly durable (predictable supply curve), and therefore it holds the promise of a universally desirable store of value and medium of exchange."
1009826009728933888,2018-06-21 15:50:57,"26/ On the contrary, Bitcoin is an incredibly powerful startup currency _because_ it fully enables plurality, scarcity, and diversity."
1009825286568009734,2018-06-21 15:48:04,25/ But Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt touch at all on the three other categories of conflict-causes. Isn‚Äôt that a setback?
1009825285653651456,2018-06-21 15:48:04,"24/ This core ability to restrict free access is not dependent on the decision of a political committee, but rather innate, hardwired in the technology. To borrow from Nick Szabo, Bitcoin is a socially scalable, conflict preventing protocol."
1009825284558909442,2018-06-21 15:48:04,"23/ However, there is one cause of conflict that Bitcoin does _not_ allow for: free access. Nobody can mint bitcoins in excess of the 21M supply, and with sufficient precautions taken, existing coins can be protected against access from anyone anywhere."
1009825283615154176,2018-06-21 15:48:03,"22/ Bitcoin 100% allows for plurality and diversity: anyone can use it, and the network is censorship resistant - opening the door for any and all diversity.¬†It is also decidedly a scarce good."
1009825282654724097,2018-06-21 15:48:03,"21/ Remember, there are 4 necessary and jointly sufficient causes for conflict: 

Plurality - multiple actors

Free access - what actors want is accessible to them

Scarcity - desired good is in finite supply

Diversity - actors have different values, opinions, preferences"
1009825281673179137,2018-06-21 15:48:03,"20/ Now, let‚Äôs switch to Bitcoin. In what ways could Bitcoin contribute to diminishing interpersonal conflict?"
1009825280679141376,2018-06-21 15:48:03,"19/ Finally ‚Äúsocial consensus‚Äù appears manageable in times of credit expansion, but obviously breaks down in a phase of deleveraging or stagflation. It is unreliable as a conflict prevention mechanism and it‚Äôs impossible to prove it offers a net benefit to society."
1009825278074507264,2018-06-21 15:48:02,"18/ Third, the monetary abundance isn‚Äôt divided evenly over the population - credit expansion &amp; bailouts generally favor debtors to the detriment of savers (causing conflict). And fourth, the resulting inflation undermines the money‚Äôs long term desirability."
1009825276476493830,2018-06-21 15:48:02,"17/ First, over time, central banks hardly ever remain free from political influence (lack of unity). Second, certain groups do get ‚Äúfree access‚Äù to newly minted money, for example those who are labeled ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù, or those allowed to engage in fractional reserve banking."
1009825273762795521,2018-06-21 15:48:01,"16/ So the ways in which government uses monetary technology to try and prevent societal conflicts is very comprehensive. However, in my opinion this approach suffers from some systemic flaws:"
1009825272122757120,2018-06-21 15:48:01,"15/ And finally, governments also pursue monetary consensus: by means of marketing and regulation, citizens are pursued to only use one money (national currency) and to endorse the local monetary policy."
1009825271229370368,2018-06-21 15:48:00,"14/ Government money is abundant: when scarcity threatens to cause conflict, new money is made available to particular groups."
1009825270352760832,2018-06-21 15:48:00,"13/ Governments curb free access: a unit of fiat money can only be owned by one person at a time, and counterfeiting generally is penalized."
1009825268645683200,2018-06-21 15:48:00,12/ Government managed money restricts plurality: there is only one entity (e.g. FOMC) which ultimately controls interest rates and money supply. The central bank has the undisputed authority and bears ultimate responsibility.
1009825267756470273,2018-06-21 15:48:00,"11/ Over time, governments have started using the institution of money, surely for their own self interest, but also to try and address interpersonal conflict in society.

Let‚Äôs look at how:"
1009825265957134336,2018-06-21 15:47:59,"10/ In order for money to reliably serve as that near universal ‚Äúkey to markets‚Äù, it must acquire several characteristics: durability, portability, divisibility, and widespread desirability."
1009825264883453953,2018-06-21 15:47:59,"9/ Enter money, a technology that helps to prevent conflict by giving people a highly marketable good that they can use to access a variety of goods and services on a non-coercive basis (i.e. providing abundance by meeting needs &amp; wants)."
1009825263897718784,2018-06-21 15:47:59,"8/ In a pre-money, barter world, people don‚Äôt have a lot of possibilities to get their needs and wants met. Even division of labor is hard: if I‚Äôm a cobbler, I can‚Äôt get eggs until the chicken farmer needs a new pair of shoes."
1009825261213442051,2018-06-21 15:47:58,7/ Now let‚Äôs apply this framework to money.
1009825260110270464,2018-06-21 15:47:58,"6/ Rather than creating abundance by ramping up production, one can also create it by diminishing one‚Äôs (perceived) needs and wants: asceticism. This was especially popular in premodern times (monasticism), and can still be found in many spiritual/religious teachings."
1009825259174944769,2018-06-21 15:47:58,"5/ In the political world, conflict prevention is usually more sought after in the areas of plurality &amp; diversity (solutions of unity &amp; consensus), whereas the business world focuses more on removing scarcity and restricting access (solutions of abundance and private property)."
1009825257417592832,2018-06-21 15:47:57,"4/ Example: There is one pancake in the room (scarcity &amp; access), and you and I both want it (plurality &amp; diversity). If I convince you that I should have the pancake (removing diversity), the conflict disappears. Another solution is to bake more pancakes (removing scarcity)."
1009825256574476288,2018-06-21 15:47:57,"3/ If one manages to completely remove just one of the four necessary causes, it effectively resolves and prevents interpersonal conflict."
1009825255018389505,2018-06-21 15:47:57,"2/ All interpersonal conflict has 4 necessary and jointly sufficient causes: 

Plurality - multiple actors

Free access - what actors want is accessible to them

Scarcity - desired good is in finite supply

Diversity - actors have different values, opinions, preferences"
