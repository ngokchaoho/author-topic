967231579855532038,2018-02-24 02:55:53,Back to the original tweet for this thread. The crypto community lives on the belief that there won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúrun on the bank‚Äù and that market participants will only convert to fiat as &amp; when they need fiat. This is ironically in stark contrast to why Bitcoin was born in 2008!
967231577594806273,2018-02-24 02:55:53,"Unless BTC &amp; ETH can hit new highs soon, I believe we will see somewhat of a 2014 era bear market cycle. BTC &amp; ETH are effectively acting as the reserve currency for the crypto industry."
967231575027929089,2018-02-24 02:55:52,Traders and speculators will move value between tokens and coins based on market sentiment but the net outflow of fiat as an industry will remain constant vs the total market cap. These daily fluctuations are indicative of a flight to quality (BTC &amp; ETH) when reducing exposure.
967231572779741184,2018-02-24 02:55:51,The problem really comes in when the net monthly sales of crypto to fund mining and operations for over 3500 projects/companies exceeds the net fiat entering the market. The current bear market cycle means that you need to sell more crypto to get the same amount of cash out.
967231570095439872,2018-02-24 02:55:51,"So every month they need to sell a little bit of crypto to pay the bills. That works well in a bull market. In a bear market, not so much. Essentially the ecosystem of innovation is funded by the fiat that has entered the system or is available when bills need to be paid."
967231566232502274,2018-02-24 02:55:50,Bitcoin was designed as a system to take on the big banks and fractional reserve system. What I‚Äôm seeing now is that a large number of funded crypto projects are only holding crypto and their runways are fluctuating every day.
